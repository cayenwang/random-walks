# new lattice definition. A lattice is a set of points with only a few qualities: adjacency, edge direction and weighting. adjacency is could 
# be  a function which checks for adjacency or it could be a function that calculates the adjacent points. Take the second option and we have 
# a function which also defines the region we are considering the walks in. Awesome now let the weightings function be none symmetric i.e 
# f(A,B) â‰  f(B,A) and bobs you uncle. let adj stand for adjacency

# biases is a function that takes an ordered touple of nodes and returns the bias in that direction 
# adj is a function that returns all the nodes adjacent to that point
